### URL-Shotener-API built with express, nanoid and mongodb
It enables a url shortening service like tinyurl and bitly by taking a url through validateUrl.js checking if it's a valid url and shortening into a 7 character string.\
An example would have the format: https/http://BASE_URL/shortenUrl where the base URL is where this app is hosted\ 
To run it locally, use `npm i` to install the dependencies and use postman to test it.\
Note: you must have:
- mongodb installed our system
- postman to test the api
Then, use `npm run api` to run it.
